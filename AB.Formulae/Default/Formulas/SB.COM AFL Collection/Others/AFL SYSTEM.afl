This is an attempt to provide a basic trading system AFL. The system is purely
imaginary
AND NOT provided as one that would make money. This is just to provide a guide
to learners
on the common components of writing AFL.

When you copy/paste ensure the existing continuous lines have not been wrapped.
This wrapping
can create error signals when you try to use the code. Click on the Check AFL
button in the
editor before trying to apply or scan.
I have used slash - asterisk /* */ /* for my comments to get around the problem
of wrapping,
which could happen if you used double slash //

I hope this helps the beginners in creating AFL code
