/* 
This is a modified version of the Heikin-Ashi HaDiffCO indicator. 
This modification gives interesting results which are still being 
examined. The best signals seem to come from weekly stock charts. 
Other investment products have not yet been thoroughly tested.

Buy signals (reverse these signals to go short):
1) Green line crosses above upper bollinger (red). Stronger signal 
if green line has departed from dark red line (which should be lower).

2) Green line crosses above lower bollinger (red). Stronger signal 
if green line has departed from dark red line (which should be higher).

3) Dark red and also green line cross above zero (0) line (black)

Reversal signals:
1) Dark red line and also green line "kiss" the upper bollinger (red). 
Both dark red and green line need to be nearly on top of each other for 
this signal to be clear.

2) Dark red line and also green line "kiss" the lower bollinger (red). 
Both dark red and green line need to be nearly on top of each other for 
this signal to be clear.

Trend signals (long-term buy and short signals):
1) Green line crossing above zero (0) line (black) indicates new uptrend. 
Stronger signal if dark red line is above zero.

2) Green line crossing below zero (0) line (black) indicates new downtrend. 
Stronger signal if dark red line is below zero.
