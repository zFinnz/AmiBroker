### Special topic: *Web Analysis*

In order to see a page with the `e` button on **AmiBroker** for a web-analysis you need to setup a mechanism to wonder!

> Go to `Tools -> Customize -> Web Pages -> New` and paste the following in the `URL` field
```
http://www.dsebd.org/print_Company.php?name={t}&tko=t&obr=t&odn=t
```
Put something(anything) in the Description field that should be shown on your address bar like:  
```
DSE (BD) company profile page
```
Move it `up` or `down` as you like using the buttons on the right of the dialog box. Moving it to the top of the list makes it a default page to open automatically by clicking on the `e` button.

You should get the company profile of the `issue open at chart` without the other bells & whistles to get a quick glimpse on the company.
